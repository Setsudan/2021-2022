# 2021-2022

This is a mono repo for the year 2021-2022 since the year is not finished I'll still add bit now and then.
At the end of 2022 I'll remove all the projects from 2021 and 2022 from all the other repositories and keep them here.
All the links will be changed on my profile so it won't be too much annoying

## Why this mono-repo

I created this mono-repo for projects I worked on, that mostly are group projects, or are old portfolios.

The reason I regroup all those projects here is because I don't want shool project's to overflow my github.
The old portfolio are things of the past so I put them on open-source but don't want them to be put on the first page.


- [Learnin](https://github.com/Setsudan/2021-2022/tree/master/Learnin) is where I learned and practice languages this year

- [Portfolio](https://github.com/Setsudan/2021-2022/tree/master/Portfolio) are where my 2 previous portfolio are

- [Halfway](https://github.com/Setsudan/2021-2022/tree/master/halfway) is a school project where we had to work for the city hall of Paris giving a solution to the problem of small shops not being able to digitalize themself

- [paintenmieux](https://github.com/Setsudan/2021-2022/tree/master/paintenmieux) is a school project where we had to create a whiteboard with javascript and php to store drafts

- [projet intranet](https://github.com/Setsudan/2021-2022/tree/master/projet%20intranet) is a school project where we had to create a a social network with php. It's a total failure tbh

- [rpg-python](https://github.com/Setsudan/2021-2022/tree/master/rpg-python) is a school project where we had to create a text based rpg

- [skull-rpg-game](https://github.com/Setsudan/2021-2022/tree/master/skull-rpg-game) is a school project where we had to create a javascript visual rpg. This project is far from being a rpg but you can move around, get items and talk to yo mama
